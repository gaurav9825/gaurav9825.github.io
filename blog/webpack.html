				<h2 id="content">Omniport Optimization</h2>
				<p>As a part of IMG, IIT-Roorkee we decided to move from old django based templates
					to separate our backend and front-end, I was made the project leader for the frontend.We run a portal
					called Channel I, and we have around ten apps running which all had to be converted to react apps
					and my job was to build the frontend infrastructure.I had to start from scratch as there was no boilerplate
					available in the market which could fulfill my need.I had to dig into the docs of webpack and babel and react
					as it is a very big project and the bundle finally generated must be very much optimized and at the same time
					i had to figure out how to keep such a large number of apps under one roof.
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<h3>Brief Background</h3>
						<p>The app is built on ReactJS and Django. It is a typical end to end application.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<h3>nOOb steps</h3>
						<p>Now, as you might know, when webpack does its magic on the code, it generates a single
							huge bundle file, that contains all the code required for front-end function. Because we
							are working with single page applications here, this means that browser will fetch all
							code at once which can lead to slower page loads which can be a bad experience for
							end users.
							<br />
							Now this id just for three apps, but as i mentioned above we will have around ten apps
							in production and going this way would be completely infeasible, not at all suitable for
							deployment. I had to think of something else. <b>I needed to reduce bundle size.</b>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<h3>Correcting some mistakes</h3>
						<p>First step was to remove unnecessary npm modules (or unused). Doing a thorough investigation
							of package.json and the codebase and using packages like
							<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck">depcheck</a>
							and removing unnecessary imports and corresponding packages was another tiresome job but it
							proved to be fruitful. package.json can get get dirty when you blindly install some packages
							for testing and then forget to remove them from dependecies.However, it took around two hours
							to remove those unwanted packages.This reduced the bundle sizes by around 150 KB.</b>

					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<h3> <i>The introduction of async await</i> </h3>
						<p>Stumbling upon reducing bundle size, I came across the concept of async await.
							It is a new way to write asynchronous code. Previous available options were Promises and
							callbacks. They are non blocking just like promises.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
						<script src="https://gist.github.com/gaurav9825/30f40c457e04920be1038b3948af63a4.js"></script>
					</div>
				</div>
				<!-- Blockquote -->
				<blockquote>An async function returns a promise implicitly, and the resolved value of the promise
					will be whatever we return from the function.
				</blockquote>
				<br />
				<div class="row">
					<!-- Break -->
					<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
						<p><b>Back on track</b></p>
						<p>The main idea is to first break the components into finer components and then load these
							components when needed. First step was to create a wrapper that would take a component,
							and return another component. These wrappers are called
							<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">Higher-Order Components (HOC).</a>
							Our HOC was an <i>async container:</i> </p>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script src="https://gist.github.com/gaurav9825/fdd1d2a3f7c2a5409dcff29fd8a69f29.js"></script>
						</div>
						<p>The asyncContainer function takes a component as input and renders it when the importComponent
							resolves. This can be implemented in routes as:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-8 col-12-small">
						<script src="https://gist.github.com/gaurav9825/258fda30ba7285848b451b9dad34ac54.js"></script>
					</div>
					<p>
						Everytime the asyncContainer is called, it will dynamicaly import the passed container. In
						other words, when we visit / route, then a chuck file is loaded dynamically containing the
						WelcomeContainer. his concept can be extended to individual components too. Suppose we have
						an header that can be split into two components RightHeader and LeftHeader. So, previously
						when header was mounted, both of these components used to come within the Header chunk,
						but now walking on our new path we can make them mount dynamically thus separating the
						view blocking components. An example of how header is rendered.

					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<p>Production build webpack created around 40 chunks (because of use of async/await), that
							will be dynamically loaded when needed.
							This practice greatly reduced the main bundle size and we were under 100KB for app1 (
							our landing page), this meant max 2 second for landing page loading (Achievement Unlocked).
							You also have to include babel-pollyfill because async/await are not included in browser by default.

						<h3>Final Problem</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
						<p>Now, after the successful deployment, the next major problem is the build time. With current config
							the build time was around 90 seconds, too much!!. We are still working on improving the build speed,
							but its on hold because of other feature addition to the application.</p>
						<i>
							I will post about how to reduce the build time in future. Till then,
