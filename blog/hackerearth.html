				<p>It all started in the month of March when i applied for frontend intern in the company
					which was started by our alumni's.I dropped a mail to hr expressing my interest to join the company.
					I got reply after three days with a link to the test to be submitted within 48 hours.I somehow
					completed the task and submiited it. Then i went through a series of interviews and Finally
					got selected.It was 10 weeks internship.

				</p>
				<p>
					I was quite excited for the internship and the same time nervous too as it was my first internship
					and i had no clue how things actually work in the corporate world.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					Never believed that I would get the opportunity to intern at a startup like HackerEarth — just after
					the 2nd year of college and yet it happened! That moment gave me a sense of achievement and
					joy — something that makes me believe in dreaming big, after all, it does not cost one to dream.

						<h3>Journey Begins</h3>
						<p>I left for bangalore on 6th of May, my intern period was from <b>7th May 18 to 17 Jul 18</b>.
							It was my first time travelling to an unknown city and that too alone, i was quite nervous
							but i knew that these ten weeks of my life would be the best time in my life.In the office
							i was welcomed by my buddy <b>Akansha Valecha</b>, who was the chief frontend enginner of the
							sprint team (my team).She was quite nice to me and always helped me in every possible manner.
						</p>

							My work involved around HackerEarth's new product called as
							<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/innovation/">Sprint</a>.
							The old product has a lot of design flaws and and the website was not responsive.
							I was assigned to work on the entire redesign of the product and it took me almost a month to
							complete the task and the result was completely resonsive for desktop as well all other devices.
