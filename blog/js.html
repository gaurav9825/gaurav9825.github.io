								<h3>Hoisting</h3>
							</li>
							<span>Let us understand hoisting by considering an example</span>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/y8Lcquer/embed/js/"></script>

						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<span>What happens if we invoke our function before we actually declare it?
							</span>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/zr513a2q/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<p><b>This is hoisting in action.</b></p>
							<p>
								So, what is happening here? Most commonly, people will explain hoisting as declarations
								being moved to top of your code. While this is what appears to be happening, it’s
								important to understand exactly what is going on. You see, code isn’t moving anywhere.
								It isn’t magically being moved to the top of the file.
								<b> What’s actually happening is
									that your function and variable declarations are added to memory during the compile phase.
								</b>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<blockquote>
								<span>Hoisting is a mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top
									of their scope before code execution.
								</span>
							</blockquote>
						</div>


						<!-- closures -->
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<li>
								<h3>Closures</h3>
							</li>
							<p>Closure in layman’s terms is simply a function inside a function, also called nested
								function. It looks pretty straight forward when we see it like this but the real magic
								is related to its scopes. A closure has three scopes, nested function has access to
								variables defined in its own scope, in the scope of its parent function and the
								global variables. This behavior of closures can be very handy when It comes to programming
								Javascript. One of all the benefits of this is the abstraction, as we all know that Javascript
								is not pure class based Object Oriented Programming language like Java and C# but we can achieve
								this OO behavior through……. YESS! → Closures. Consider the
								following code
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/k9ey5fuw/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<p>
								In the code above you can see that the getFullName() function has the access to the outer function’s
								firstName and lastName properties and we can think of var object as an Object having these two
								properties and getFullName() a method as in an OOP language. The other important thing to notices
								here is that we can’t access the properties here, no matter
								they are part of foo, the reason behind this is the return statement, we have only given access
								to the method not the properties. It kind of works like the access modifiers of OOP language,
								to make that code work, we have to do something like this:
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/srgn2de0/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<p>
								One very important thing to be noticed is that after foo() statement is executed in the previous
								code
								snippet, variables inside the foo() function will not be destroyed (unlike other functions when they return,
								their
								variables are destructed) because of closures as the scope is kept alive here and child function can still
								access the
								properties of parent function.
							</p>
						</div>


						<!-- callbacks  -->
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<li>
								<h3>Callbacks</h3>
							</li>
							<p>Callbacks is a very important concept in javascript as it can be very handy in many scenarios.
								A callback is simply a function that is passed to another function as a parameter and is invoked
								or executed inside the other function. This might not seem helpful now but it will be pretty clear
								after the following example. Suppose there is a function that takes a studentId as a parameter and
								returns the employee object returned from the server based on that Id and we have
								to show that student returned from this function, on screen.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/q1kbr2hg/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							<p>
								It looks fine when we see it but there is a problem when we execute it. The problem is the function
								returns a null and the reason behind is that ajax call is asynchronous and executed separately
								waiting for the result from the server and meanwhile function returns the same null value that
								we assigned earlier.
								<br>
								Here comes the callbacks. The simplest solution to this problem is passing a callback that is invoked when the
								result
								arrives from server. After doing that the code will look something like this:
							</p>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/wbvhdg8p/embed/js/"></script>

								Callback solved our problem but let just think for a second that we just handled the success scenario not the
								failure, for that we will have to pass another callback function (success and failure cases) and what if we
								want to
								execute two or more back to back async operations where each subsequent function starts when the previous one
								is
								completed.This can be easily haCallback solved our problem but let just think for a second that we just
								handled the success scenario not the failure, for that we will have to pass another callback function
								(success and failure cases) and what if we want to execute two or more back to back async operations
								where each subsequent function starts
								when the previous one is completed. This can be easily handled with promises.ndled with promises.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- promises -->
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<li>
								<h3>Promises</h3>
							</li>
							<p>According to
								<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises">
									developer.mozilla :
								</a>
							</p>
						</div>
						<blockquote>
							A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
							Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a
							function.
						</blockquote>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							The benefits of using promises are:
						</div>
						<br>
						<blockquote>
							<ul>
								<li>We can do chaining with promises i.e. executing two or more asynchronous operations back to back</li>
								<li>Callbacks will never be called before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop</li>
								<li>Callbacks added with .then even after the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be called</li>
								<li>Multiple callbacks may be added by calling .then several times, to be executed independently in insertion
									order
								</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							We will discuss some of these concepts later. But first create our own promise and convert the previous
							getStudentById() code to return a promise and then attach our callbacks to that.
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/wg5pfa4h/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							In code above, in case of success, we resolve the promise and pass data from server to resolve which eventually
							passes
							to successCallback and invoke attached callback, and incase of failure, promise will be rejected and
							failureCallback
							will be invoked. One of the benefits of using promises is that, lets suppose we want to do two asynchronous
							operations
							and the second operation is <b>dependent on the result of first operation.</b> It can be done easily with
							promises like
							this:
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/L5m6f97o/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							The second operation will be executed after the first one is completed and firstOnes result will be passed to
							the
							second. This is called Chaining in promises and is one of significant benefits of promises. Another advantageous
							use
							case of promises is, let suppose we want to do something when all of our promises are resolved, we have to wait
							for all
							the promises to resolve and then perform some operation on the basis of results of all. We can do something like
							this:
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
							<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/gaurav9825/w1f25c4g/embed/js/"></script>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="col-12 col-12-small">
							It is resolved when all the promises in the array are resolved and rejected when any of them is rejected. Modern
							functions (like Angular $http module) return promises, we just have to attach our callbacks to it and don’t need
							to
							write our own.
						</div>
						<br>

								<h3>Javascript Event Loop</h3>
							</li>
							<p>“How is JavaScript asynchronous and single-threaded ?” The short answer is that JavaScript language is
								single-threaded and the asynchronous behaviour is not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather
								they are built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser (or the programming environment) and
								accessed through the browser APIs.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Basic Architecture</h3>
						<img src="../images/event-loop.png" alt="">

						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Heap</b> - Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large mostly unstructured
								regionof memory.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Stack</b> - This represents the single thread provided for JavaScript code execution. Function calls form a
								stack of frames (more on this below).
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Browser or Web APIs</b> - are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the browser and
								surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. They are not part of the JavaScript
								language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing you with extra
								superpowers to use in your JavaScript code. For example, the Geolocation API provides some simple JavaScript
								constructs for retrieving location data so you can say, plot your location on a Google Map. In the
								background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++) to communicate with the
								device’s GPS hardware (or whatever is available to determine position data),
								retrieve position data, and return it to the browser environment to use in your code. But again, this
								complexity is abstracted away from you by the API.
